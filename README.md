# BINGO
BINGO game made by me using c language. its a basic console level game played between a player and computer.

This game takes every time random numbers.
As we run the program its asks first for the name of the player.
Then to enter the numbers from 1 to 25 into the 5*5 matrix.
Also the computer prepares its own matrix in the memory.
Then the player and computer gives the numbers alternately,the number is not repeated when once given.
The one who makes the 5 combiniations vertically or horizontally or diagonally wins the game and the message is provided as such.
